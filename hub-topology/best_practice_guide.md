# Best Practice Guide for OEDISI Component Development

- Purpose: Practical, repeatable steps for building a new OEDISI component.
- Audience: Component developers and integrators working with the `oedisi` framework.

## Repository & Project Setup
- Prefer location: Create the new component inside the `oedisi-example` repository.
  Keeping components together simplifies testing, version control, and CI/integration workflows.
- If adding to `oedisi-example`: Create a top-level directory `oedisi-example/<component-name>/`
  and follow the recommended layout.
- Required docs: Add `LICENSE.md` and `CONTRIBUTORS.json` that describe commit/PR expectations
  and how to run tests locally.
- Alternate location: For independently versioned components, create a dedicated repository
  under the `openEDI` organization (not preferred).
- Prohibited: Avoid private or internal-only repositories.

## Recommended Component Layout
- `component/` — source package (python module, go module, etc.).
- `tests/unit/` — unit tests for core logic.
- `tests/integration/` — system-level tests that run the component with other federates or a minimal orchestrator.
- `examples/` — example configs, `component_definition.json`, `input_mapping.json`, sample data.
- `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml` — for replicable integration test runs.
- `README.md` — usage, configuration, and quickstart (also update central docs).

## Scaffolding Steps
- Create the directory under `oedisi-example/` and initialize git (or create a repository under `openEDI`).
- Add `.gitignore`, `LICENSE.md`, and `README.md`.
- Scaffold a minimal package in `component/` with a clear entry point, configuration loader,
  and a simple run loop that can be exercised by tests.
- Add `component_definition.json` describing inputs/outputs and include an example `input_mapping.json` in `examples/`.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Keep logic pure and unit-testable. Use `pytest` (or the project standard).
  Put tests in `tests/unit/`.
- Mock dependencies: Abstract external systems (HELICS, databases) with adapter interfaces
  so unit tests can use fast mocks.
- Integration tests: Put end-to-end tests in `tests/integration/`. Use a local HELICS broker
  or `docker-compose` to run multiple federates for system tests.
- Test data & fixtures: Store small representative datasets in `examples/` or `tests/fixtures/`
  so CI runs quickly.

## Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions: Create workflows to run unit tests on each PR and a separate workflow/job
  for integration tests (nightly or on-demand if they are long-running).
- Integration job config: Use `services`, `docker-compose`, or reusable workflows to
  bring up HELICS and dependent services.
- Dependency caching: Cache dependencies to speed up CI runs.

## Documentation & Discovery
- Live docs: Keep this best practice guide and the component `README.md` up to date
  as you add features.
- Component metadata: Maintain `component_definition.json` to reflect actual inputs,
  outputs, and configuration.
- Examples: Provide at least one runnable example in `examples/` demonstrating a typical
  run and expected outputs.

## Collaboration & Avoiding Silos
- Don't build in a silo: Avoid side-loading models or making large, undocumented changes in a single component.
- Start minimal: Implement a small, well-documented component that demonstrates the required
  inputs/outputs and includes a `component_definition.json`. Use this artifact to propose
  core API or schema changes.
- Communicate early: Open an issue or RFC in the appropriate `openEDI` repo describing the change,
  expected APIs, and link to the minimal example so reviewers can run and test it.
- Design for extensibility: Prefer plug-ins or optional configuration over hard-coded changes.
  Provide fallbacks so the component can run even if core features are not yet available.

## Release & Contribution Workflow
- Use semantic or conventional commits to help automate changelogs.
- Use PR templates and require at least one reviewer for new components or breaking changes.
- PR checklist: unit tests pass, integration smoke-tested (if applicable), docs updated,
  and `component_definition.json` validated.

## Checklist (Quick Start)
- Create component scaffold under `oedisi-example/<component-name>/`.
- Add `component_definition.json` and an example `helics_config.json` in `examples/`.
- Implement unit tests in `tests/unit/` and run them locally:

  ```bash
  pytest tests/unit
  ```

- Add an integration test in `tests/integration/` and provide `docker-compose.yml` to run it:

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
  ```

- Update the component `README.md` and this best practice guide with usage and test instructions.
